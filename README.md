## 📁 Project
This was a web development class project, which we had to create a full CRUD app, using **Express**, **Node** and **Javascript**. 


## 🔃 How to use it
Open the project file, and execute the following code in your terminal:
~~~javascript
node express.js
~~~
After that, go to your browser and enter the following link:
http://localhost:3000/items/

## 💡 Reminder

You'll need a JSON API testing app. The recommended app is Postman, but feel free to use your preferred tool.
